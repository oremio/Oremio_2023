- 小作文
    1. 小作文重点背：推荐信/介绍信、建议信、投诉信，询问信/求助信，道歉信。
    2. 称谓：**称呼最后面一定要加逗号**。称呼要**顶格写**，每个**实词的首字母要大写**，虚词的首字母则不需要大写，如冠词，连词，介词等。
        - 不特定主体：(1)Dear Sir or Madam, (2)*To Whom It May Concern,*
        - 特定主体：(1)Dear + 人名, (2)Dear + 性别 + 姓或者姓名或者职称,
    3. 正文都用缩头式，也就是每段的开头空四个字母。
    4. 第一段：自我介绍或者*写信背景 + 写信目的*。
        1. **学生身份**：如我是西方大学中文专业的大三学生或者我是西方大学的学生会主席。
        2. **职业身份**：如我是某个报社的记者。
        3. **社会成员身份**：如我是一位购买XX产品的用户。
        4. **熟人信件和回信不需要自我介绍**，第一段第1句要根据题目提供的信息改写，例如英语二历年考过回信感谢邀请，回信感谢祝贺，祝贺考上大学等。
        5. 考试规定：**自我介绍可以自己随便编，但是不能出现除了清华和北大外的国内具体大学的名称**，国外大学或者不存在的大学名称都可以写，例如西方大学。如果考试题目有出现特定身份，就必须按特定的身份写。例如2015年英语一我是读书俱乐部成员。
        6. 模板里的自我介绍**只需要背一个**。
    5. 第二段：写两个具体理由或具体内容特别注意事项：两个具体理由和内容自己随便编，这个理由只要能跟衔接的模板句串起来意思匹配，逻辑通顺即可。
    6. 第三段：*感谢阅读 + 保持联系*或者期待回复
        - 特别注意事项:
            - **感谢信和道歉信无需期待回复**。
            - **模板里的第三段，意思相近的模板句只需要背一句即可**。你可以根据中文翻译比对找出意思相近的句子。
            - 小作文的落款部分，**所有信函都可以用Yours sincerely万能落款**。
            - 签名部分略有差异，私入信函可以直接写入名．英语一要求写Li Ming。
            - 公务信函的签名，如果是代表某个机构写信，最后签名要写明该机构。
            - 另落款和签名都要写在右下角，注意大小写。
